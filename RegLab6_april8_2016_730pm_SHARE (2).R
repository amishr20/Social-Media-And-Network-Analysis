# Function definition #
# Students: Please modify the function below according to the lab exercise instructions
################


# This one implements stats for susceptible as well as remove
# Also, make use of the susceptible again feature
# Please note that the only required argument for this function is the graph object. The other arguments can be overriden or skipped by the calling function; if skipped,
# the default values are used.
# Arguments: 1) network.i: graph object (required), 2) simlength: number of iterations (rounds) for the simulation, 3) p.t: probability of infecting a connected susceptible neighbor, if a node is infected
# 4) display_net: show the evolving network plots for each round of the simulation (press Enter to continue, q to quit). Set it to FALSE if you have a lot of 
# rounds and just want to collect the summary timestats. 5) removeafter: Number of rounds that an infected node can infect neigbors (infectious), 
# after which it moves to a Removed state where it is immune and not infectious. 5) susceptibleafter: Number of rounds after which a node in the Removed state becomes susceptible to infection again
